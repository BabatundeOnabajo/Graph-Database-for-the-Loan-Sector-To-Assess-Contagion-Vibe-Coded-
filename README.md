# Graph-Database-for-the-Loan-Sector-To-Assess-Contagion-Vibe-Coded-
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) that represents the connections different financial institutions have with one other to see the level of exposure that they accumulate when they lend to another financial institution. It was developed for the LMA Edge hackathon and was "vibe coded" in the AWS Bedrock platform using the Claude Opus 4 model.

# Requiremets
There are minimal requirements for this program. You _can_ have a Companies House API key, although this is not necessary as there is a Demo version within this program itself. Having a Companies House API key only means you can see the level of exposure risk with actual, existing organisations, whilst the Demo version only portrays fictional organisations. You must have JavaScript enabled within your browser. 

# Instructions
To use this program, simply copy the contents of index.html into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as VS Code or even a tool like Notepad and save it as "index.html". You then only need to run the file in your browser.
